Algorithm #1:

1. Shake random ID from urn.

2. i. If own ID is received, leave the party.
   
   ii. Otherwise, form a circle with the other students with random ID's.
   
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all students have received an ID.
   
4. Have one student (student L) switch ID's with the person to their right
   (student R).

5. i. If either of the student receive their ID, they may leave.

	 ii. Otherwise if both students do not have their ID, student R
             becomes  student L.
	 
	 iii. Otherwise the remaining of the two becomes student L.
	 
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until All students have received their own ID.


Algorithm #2:

1. num1 = the base 12 number.

2. num2 = the last digit of num1.

3. Remove the last digit of num1.

4. Add the last digit of num1 to the end of num2.

5. Remove the last digit of num1.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have exhausted num1.

7. n = 0.

8. sum = 0.

9. num3 = the first digit of num2.

10. If num3 = A, replace A with 10.

11. If num3 = B, replace B with 11.

12. Remove the first digit of num2.

13. num4 = 12 to the power of n times num3.

14. sum = sum + num4.

15. n = n + 1.

16. Repeat steps 9 through 15 until you exhaust num2.

17. Sum is now the original base 12 number converted to base 10.


Algorithm #3:

1. Pick a word and assign it to W1.

2. Pick another word and assign it to W2.

3. n = 1.

4. Compare letter n of W1 and W2.

5. If both letters are the same and have the same capitalization,
	 n = n + 1.
	 
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until letters are not the same, do not have
	 the same capitilization or one or both letters is the null character 
	 (no more letters).
	 
7. If both letters are null, the lexicographic difference is 0.

8. If the letters are the same but do not have the same
	 capitilization, the lexicographic difference is 32.
	 
9. If one word is null and the other is not

    i. And the letter is lowercase, the lexicographic differnce is the
       distance of the letter from a + 97. 
    
    ii. And the letter is uppercase, the lexicographic difference is the
        distance of the letter from A + 65.	 
  
10. Otherwise, l1 = the letter at position n of W1 and l2 = the letter at
    position n of W2.
		
11. i. If l1 is lowercase, the numercial value (n1) is the distance of the
       letter l1 from a + 97.
   
    ii. If l1 is uppercase, the numerical value (n1) is the distance of the
        letter l1 from A + 65.
    
12. Repeat step 11 with l2 in place of l1 and n2 in place of n1.

13. The lexicographic difference of the words is the absolute value of n1 - n2.
