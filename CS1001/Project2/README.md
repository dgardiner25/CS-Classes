# Project 2

Project options and details are available
[on the course website](http://dsl.mwisely.xyz/projects/2/).

For this project, I chose:

<!-- Simply put an 'x' in the box to check it. It'll show up as a
check mark on GitLab. Markdown is really neat. -->

- [ ] Project A: Makefile Helpers
- [x] Project B: C++ Standard Library
- [ ] Project C: GUIs
- [ ] Project D: [Your title here]

<!-- If you chose Project D, you should include the project criteria
in this README, as well. Just put a quick summary of what you and Mike
discussed. -->

<!-- Feel free to edit this README! -->

<!-- This would be a good place to tell the graders how to compile and
run your code. It would also be a good place to list any
comments/complaints/feedback you have about the project. -->


*This is NOT the place for responses to Project questions. Those go in
`answers.md`!*
