-------- Problem 1 --------
Question 1:
  - 1. bash compiley.sh program.cpp hello
  - 2. The script takes the first and second arguments of the command
       and assigns them to variables. Then, the g++ command is used with the
       variables that hold the arguments. Therefore, the first argument will
       be the name of the program and the second will be what the name of
       the executable is.

Question 2:
  - 1. Nope.
  - 2. Rather than there being only 2 arguments ("my program.cpp" and
       hello), there is 3 (my, program.cpp, and hello). The script thinks
       that my is the file name and there is no input file with that name.

Question 3:
  - 1. Nope.
  - 2. It thinks that the input is '$@'

Question 4:
  - 1. Yep.
  - 2. It is saying to include everything that is in double quotes as well.
