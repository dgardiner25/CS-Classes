Project B: Version Control
==========================
1. `git rebase` takes the commits from a branch and puts it in another
   branch, making it seem like there was never a different branch in the
   first place.
2. `HEAD` generally refers to the most recent commit in the current
   branch but you can have a detached `HEAD` when you checkout a commit
   rather than a branch.
3. git [command] master^   
   git [command] HEAD~3.
