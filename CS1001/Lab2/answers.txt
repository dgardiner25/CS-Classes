Problem 1:
  1. The output gives a detailed list of the visible files.
  2. The output gives a detailed list of all files (visible and hidden).
  3. It forcibly removes all files in the directory.

Problem 2:
  1. 'man passwd' shows the manual for passwords. 
  2. Type 'man passwd' (I don't really know how else you would do it).
  3. PATH and $TERM

Problem 3:
  1. "apple".
  2. "banana".
  3. It contains banana and then carrot on the next line. >> Adds the input
  to the next line and > Just replaces everything with the input.
  4. | combines two functions to be ran together.

Problem 4:
  1. I get each line and check the first character of the line. If there is
not a # in the beginning, the line is added to the story variable to be
output at the end. The shell command is 'echo "story goes here" | ./a.out'.
  2. Can enter in anything I want. Once I enter the "exit" character (being
E in this case), anything that I entered in is output, minus any line that
started with a #.
