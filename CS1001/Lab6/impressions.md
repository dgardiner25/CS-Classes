Geany
=====

*What I liked*
* It was pretty simplistic

*What I didn't like*
* Felt like I was using a program from the 90's
* Not very fast compiling/running

*What features do I wish it had?*
* Nothing really, just a prettier UI

Code::Blocks
============

*What I liked*
* A little more up-to-date than Geany

*What I didn't like*
* Maybe a program from the early-mid 2000's
* Even slower than Geany

*What features do I wish it had?*
* I'm not a picky girl, just a prettier UI please
